# Features

- **Drag and Drop Track(s)**: Toss your tracks—single files or a batch—into the tool with a quick drag and drop. No fuss, just get your audio in the game, whether it’s a pristine rip or a beat-up mystery.

- **Lookup in Spotify Library**: We hit up Spotify’s library via its API, searching for a match. It scans the track’s audio fingerprint and pulls potential hits—artist, title, BPM, energy, all the goods—straight from Spotify’s massive catalog.

- **Repair with AI Assistance**: If the metadata’s missing, wrong, or half-baked (no artist? garbled title?), Spotify’s data starts the fix. AI jumps in to refine it—analyzing the audio itself to confirm the match and fill gaps, ensuring “Sweet Child O’ Mine” isn’t tagged as elevator jazz.

- **Export to DJ Deck**: Once repaired, export the track—metadata intact—straight to your DJ deck. No detours, just a clean handoff to your setup, ready to spin without a hiccup.
